# How to Succeed in College
This blog post is a collection of thoughts and techniques that I found useful, or would have found useful, when entering college. The post is dedicated to all my family members who will soon be college freshman.

## What Does This Article Treat as Success?
Success can take many forms, so it is important to establish what this post means by "success." Here, I define success as exiting college with a good job, one which pays well and which you approach with curiosity and interest. There are other metrics by which one can define "success" - for example, how well did you learn critical thinking skills? Did you find your true calling? Did you win first place in the soccer championship?

I focus on employability in this article because I believe other aspects of success come much more easily to those with the financial backing of a job than those without. Improving critical thinking skills is vital to one's long-term success in today's dynamic society, but in my opinion, is best learned after college through books, talking to people, and generally continuing your education, as you should. Don't waste your time trying to discover your true calling in college, either. You'll likely try out many different jobs and career paths throughout your life, discovering through direct experience what you like and what you don't, rather than pondering about it in your dorm room. Finally, from my own experience, you and others will quickly forget the tournaments you won and lost in college. Unless you are getting a job with a professional sports team (an ultra-competitive career choice that I don't advise for the average student), don't sweat your triumphs and defeats in sports or other competitive activities (debate, chess, etc).
