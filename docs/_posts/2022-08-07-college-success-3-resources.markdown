The following is a list of formal resources that most colleges have and which you should learn about and use:

- A career office. They might have a list of alumni you can contact to learn about future career paths. They might also host career fairs where recruiters go, looking to hire people. Go to the office in person, talk to the people there, and find out how you can stay in touch and learn about what events they have.
- Libraries and study places. Find the places that have the best hours for you, whether you prefer studying early in the morning or late at night. Make them your formal "I go here to learn" places, so that they trigger your mind to study when you go there.
- Classrooms. If you have the option to take a class remotely, go in person anyway. It will be easier to learn without the distractions of home. It's also easier to ask the professor questions after class when you stand physically between him and the door.
- Counselors. These people can help make sure you are on track to finish the requirements of your major. Before you commit to signing up for classes each term, make sure to get the sign-off from both your counselor and your major's department to make sure you are on track to complete the courses in the given amount of time.
- Lists of classes needed for your major. From freshman year, you should have a rough idea of what classes you need to take throughout the next four years to attain your goal. If you plan to start in community college and transfer, you should have a clear picture of what classes you need to take to make that switch. You should also establish contact with the target university, and your major department within it, to verify your current class list.
- Any program which teaches you about the university's resources. These are sometimes offered at the beginning of the school year, especially for freshman. They can tell you about the unique learning resources available and how best to utilize them. Best of all, they will cover any gaps I missed here!
