Your college classes should be difficult. If they aren't, you should question why you are in them. That said, here is my list of tips that should help you when you feel stuck, down, or that you otherwise can't cut it. You can, and with the right techniques, you will!

# 1. Ruthlessly Prioritize
One of the most common mistakes people make when they get to college is signing up for too many classes and activities in the first semester.

Taking too many classes sets you up for failure by spreading your attention so thin that you cannot focus on anything. Your enthusiasm and curiosity will quickly fade if you can't keep up with your assignment due dates.

Taking too many extracurriculars also sets you up for failure. You'll inevitably miss out on meetings and disappoint your new friends.

**My advice is to assume that the classes you take will be hard, then take the minimum amount of credits you need per semester to complete the requirements of your educational program. Pair the classes with one extracurricular, or perhaps two if the weekly time requirement is only a few hours each.**

But wouldn't it be better to take more classes so that you learn more, you might ask? No. Spreading yourself too thin doesn't mean you learn more. Furthermore, your future employer doesn't know the details of your college and doesn't know how many credit hours people normally take at your university. What they do see, and can more easily compare across candidates, is your GPA. Your GPA is a sign that you can commit to something and do well in it. It is also a sign that you learned the material well, which means you should be better equipped to use that knowledge in your job. (Whether the data confirms if GPA correlates to on-the-job success, I cannot say; I can only say from my own experience that GPA matters to employers). They won't care if you mastered the art of chess or learned ballroom dance. They will care whether you can program or if you know the basics of digital circuits.

As for your one extracurricular, if you want to further increase your employability, you can also select an extracurricular in your domain of interest. For example, if you are majoring in biology and planning to apply to medical school after college, sign up to volunteer at a hospital. For engineers, extracurriculars can be an excellent opportunity to apply what you've learned in class to hands-on projects, arm you with more engineering friends, and can even earn you the attention of companies looking to hire. Building a solar car or joining a robotics league are good examples. Of course, you can always try something totally different from your major to broaden your development. Having been a shy high schooler, I signed up for debate in college, and it helped me gain confidence in my speaking skills. Generally, you should use your extracurricular as a growth opportunity, wherever you need that growth. And make sure to have fun with it!

You might think this ruthless prioritization will leave you with too much free time. No, that blank space on your calendar isn't "free time" - it's study time, sleep time, exercise time, and social support time.

# 2. Book ample study time
Most of your free time should be spent studying. I used to time myself in college, and from my own observations, the average engineering class took 10 hours per week outside of office hours and class. This time includes working on homework and studying for exams. On the weeks before exams, the number would go up slightly. Other classes might take 5-7 hours per week outside of class, depending on the workload. So if you're taking three engineering classes and one class with a lower workload, plan to spend at least 37 hours on classwork per week, which is slightly more than 5 hours of classwork per day. Block out this time on your calendar, and try to spread out the work for each class so that you do a little every day. This will help you remember the material better, rather than only exposing yourself to it once a week, then forgetting it the other six days.

To learn more efficiently, prioritize going to office hours for your classes, especially those where you need help. Mark this time down in your calendar as well. You can't go to office hours too much.

# 3. Sleep 7-9 hours per night
DO NOT pull all-nighters. EVER. I did it once and it was a horrible idea. Get 7-9 hours every night. Sleep helps with memory formation and mood regulation, so you'll learn better and feel better if you sleep.

Some healthy sleep habits:
1. Stop eating and drinking 2 hours before bed
2. Don't drink caffeine after 2 PM
3. Avoid alcohol
4. Keep your bedroom cool at night and use blankets to keep warm
5. Go to bed at the same time each day. Wake up at the same time each day.
6. Establish a relaxing bedtime routine to get your mind in the mood for sleep.

There's a myth that in college, you can have friends, good grades, or sleep: pick two. I had all three. (Ok, most of my friends were in my extracurriculars and study groups, but they are friends nonetheless!) Don't compromise on your health or sanity during college and make sure to get adequate sleep.

# 4. Exercise routinely
Make time for exercise, ideally at least 30 minutes a day. If you don't normally exercise, start now. There are numerous studies that demonstrate the beneficial effects of exercise on learning and creativity. Exercise helps you sleep better and helps you feel calmer and happier, giving you the resilience you need to rise to the challenges of college.

# 5. Invest in your study tools
Whatever your major, find out what tools you need to succeed and invest in them. After all, your college is already expensive, even if you just look at the opportunity cost of the earnings you could have made working immediately after high school. You might as well spend a little more money to ensure that initial seed investment is a success.

Talk to peers in your major, TAs, and professors, and ask what they recommend.

# 6. Learn how to engage with experts
Your professor or TA might or might not be good at teaching. In The Extended Mind, Annie Murphy Paul analyzes what separates experts from novices. Experts look at material in chunks; they know what's important and what's not; and they have an underlying structure to knowledge that novices lack. Armed with this knowledge, if you're having trouble understanding something, you can ask questions to break down concepts into smaller pieces, ask what's important and what's not, and ask about the underlying conceptual structure.

The research is insightful, although from my own experience, what was most helpful was showing up to office hours consistently. Even if they are horrible teachers, with enough time, you'll eventually catch on.

Another great technique is to read notes before the lecture in which they are taught. This makes it easier to ask questions during class (because you've already thought about it) and can better engage with the professor.

# 7. Learn how to engage with peers

#### Don't compare yourself
Your peers might be a lot better than you are in classes. It might seem like it comes more easily to them. Or, they might struggle where you thrive. In any case, be careful to avoid comparisons. They come from a different high school and family, and their experiences have shaped where they are today. If they are better than you, it's an opportunity to learn from them. If they are not as good, it is an opportunity to teach them. Whether you get to learn from them or they teach you, it's a winning situation.

#### Work on problem sets together
Working with peers on problem sets will make homework more fun and will make concepts more memorable. Of course, academic integrity is essential, so make sure that working on problem sets together doesn't turn into inappropriate sharing. Ask the professor what's appropriate and what's not, and follow their guidelines.

#### Teach them
Teaching forces you to reframe what you think you know so you can tell it to other people. Then they ask you probing questions about your knowledge, which gives you a reason to reanalyze the material and correct any mistaken prior beliefs. Never let a grading curve keep you from sharing knowledge. I always found it better to use teaching as a learning opportunity for myself, and plus found it morally backward to harm someone's growth to benefit myself. They'll probably return the favor to you in the future, anyway.

# 8. Make knowledge more memorable
Your brain learns by placing new knowledge in the context of existing knowledge. Below are some techniques I learned (after college when I had the chance to read more books) which would have been very useful to me. I hope they can help unblock you when all else fails!

Of course, the best first step to take if you're totally lost is to talk to your TAs, professors, and peers. However, the following techniques can help when you understand the information, but just need to make it stick in your mind.

#### Create a memory palace
People have been using this technique for thousands of years. It is a hack that works because of the brain's remarkable ability to remember places and maps. A quick summary of the technique is that you pick a place that you know well, then take the list of items you need to remember and place an item in different locations as you walk through that place you remember well. You can use the exaggeration and emotion techniques below to make that knowledge even more memorable.

I recommend this article for a quick example: https://artofmemory.com/wiki/How_to_Build_a_Memory_Palace/

#### Steep your dry material in emotion
What's one of your earliest memories? Chances are, it involves some emotionally compelling experience. Our brains remember highly emotional situations, a good survival technique for avoiding the cave of that fearsome bear, but also a great thing to know to hack your learning. If you're finding the material difficult to remember, try to find a way to inject a little emotion into it. My own favorite example is semiconductors in electrical engineering. Basically, to get any useful properties out of a semiconductor, you have to dope it with impurities; for example, you might dope silicon with boron. You do this to excite some electrons to increase conductivity. (Are you still awake?) It was only years later when I reviewed this material in my master's classes that I realized there's a strange analogy you can make with silicon. Ok, so you're doping it? That sounds like a drug. (I highly advise against the use of drugs, but in this case, it makes for an interesting and safe story). Alright, now what happens once you drug up these silicon atoms? You excite them to get over some energy band? What is this band that you must get so excited to see it?

After I had these thoughts, I (1) wondered how on earth electrical engineering professors could ever tell the story of semiconductors with a straight face, and (2) never forgot the basics of transistor materials.

#### Exaggerate
This technique goes hand in hand with emotions, but stretching features of a concept in your head can make it much more memorable. For example, imagine a tasty peach, and in your mind, place it on your kitchen table at home. Ok, a nice image, but one you'll probably forget in a day or two, which explains the fruit that you sometimes forget until it rots on the counter. 

Now instead, imagine a peach the height of a polar bear sitting on your kitchen table. It's so heavy with summer juices that it's splitting at the seams and getting the floor all sticky. You're not sure if you should drink it with a straw or try delicately sawing at it with your puny knife, or whether you'll get scolded for eating it before cleaning up the mess. Maybe you even see a tiny boy crawling out of it with his buggy pals, and now you have to house and feed them for a few days. Does the peach belong to the boy, or will he let you eat it? Can you just take a tiny bite without him noticing? This is a lot harder of an image to forget.

#### Learn a system for remembering digits
In 20 seconds, look at these digits and remember them:

949-521-590-952-8409

How many did you get right?

In 10 seconds, look at these words and memorize them:

PURPLE ANTELOPES PLAYIN' FRISBEE

Was that a bit easier? What if I told you that you can decode the statement about the colorful mammals to mean the exact same thing as those seemingly random digits? The encoding I use here comes from the Major System. There are variations on this system, but in short, it's a way for you to encode numbers as sounds. Rather than explain how it works, I'll just recommend the following article:

https://litemind.com/major-system/

This method might work well on certain history exams when it's necessary to recall certain exact dates. It also works wonders for remembering your credit card number.

Some people will criticize such a system, saying that if you're mindlessly storing data in your brain, you're not really understanding it. However, the advantage to such a system is that you allow your mind a way of recalling the information so that you can access it for thinking in the future. Overall, I agree it's generally better to build a framework of knowledge in a subject and slot in various dates around that (for example, recalling the date of the Civil War by bounding it somewhere after the founding of the country and before the turn of the twentieth century), but this system is fun and works when you don't yet have that scaffolding of knowledge.

#### Use gesture
Just as your mind is adept at remembering physical maps, your brain also works well with your hands. Your hands can help you offload information into the physical space around you, and let you experiment with knowledge to help clear the path to understanding. For example, you might be learning calculus and the idea of a slope. Try gesturing with your hands to show yourself a slope. Then with your other hand, make a "T" shape with the first hand. Now you have a line that is orthogonal to the slope. Using your hands can make knowledge stickier by making abstract concepts (like calculus) more concrete and literally within your grasp. This technique works especially well when learning with others: you can understand each other better by following words and hands, rather than just words. The book "The Extended Mind" devotes an entire chapter to the research on gesture, and it is worth reading.

#### Write it down 
Writing is a method of thinking. By writing down your thoughts, you offload them from your mind and begin to inspect the ideas from a new perspective. One study I read about told the story of people who wrote their opinions on a problem down, then criticized their own written statements later, after they had forgotten who had written it. We are often less critical of our own thoughts than those of others, so it can help to externalize your thoughts to approach it from a new perspective. This alone might help you realize some piece of knowledge you were missing to understand a concept! It also helps to write down your questions before office hours so you know what to ask beforehand. Finally, try summarizing key learnings of a class in your own words before an exam.

#### Draw it
Drawing is fun! And it externalizes your memories as well. Use the drawing technique with the other techniques above to make information stickier.

#### Make knowledge maps
This is another technique that works by drawing the abstract into the physical space, and which brings together all of the techniques above. Tie together concepts in a map and draw it on paper, or on your electronic device. Find a way to map the concepts and figure out the logical paths that connect them. This is a nice way to summarize the big concepts your learned in a class, especially before an exam.

My professors would often allow us one 8x11 sheet of paper on which we could write any information we wanted, and we could access it during an exam. Handwriting grew miniscule. While they did help on exams, they were more helpful as a study tool for seeing the larger picture of the class all at once.

# 9. Learn to deal with your emotions in healthy ways
As well as you plan your schedule, and as many learning techniques as you employ, college can still be stressful, just as any other phase of life. You will help yourself immensely now and in the future by learning healthy ways of handling your emotions. Below is my own summary of techniques, although there are many books on the topic that I encourage you to read.

#### Listen to your body
How are you feeling right now? How is your posture? Is anything stiff or sore? How is your emotional state? In The Extended Mind, the author talks about research that suggests our bodies sense before our conscious minds have the chance to understand, so sometimes it can help to use your body as an antenna to understand your emotions before they creep up on you. Give yourself whatever you need so that your emotions don't overwhelm you without you being able to control them. If you are growing frustrated because it's been an hour and you've made zero progress on your problem set, get up and take a short walk, and come back when you feel better. (And maybe write down your thinking on the problem so far, and move on to another problem for now).

#### Accept your emotions
It is never wrong to feel a certain way. You might feel homesick, or bored in class, or jealous that you didn't do as well on an exam as your friend. Those are all understandable feelings, and you shouldn't blame yourself for your feelings. Just acknowledge the feeling and if you don't like it, plan a way to change it. Maybe you call your parents every week to reduce the homesickness, or talk about it to a friend. You can deal with boredom by reading notes before class and asking more questions during lecture. Maybe you can turn that jealousy into pride for your friend by seeing them through the eyes of their parents and thinking about all the things they overcame in life to get to their successes. Ultimately, you can't blame yourself for what emotions arise, but you can hold yourself responsible for acknowledging those emotions and finding ways to make them better.

#### Use anxiety and stress to your advantage
There's a lot of talk nowadays about the dangers of stress and anxiety, and how they can wreck our health, our lives, etc. Sure, if you overdo it (like anything), stress and anxiety can eat you alive. But there's also a reason stress and anxiety exist: they get you to act! If you're stressed about something, it probably means it's important to you, so you should give the matter the attention it needs. Stress can also help you perform better on exams by helping you focus. This advice goes hand-in-hand with the advice above to accept your emotions: accept that you're stressed, see the positive side of it, and figure out the best steps forward for yourself.

Of course, you should also get help when you need it. For me, this was my frequent crying spells to my parents (poor things... paying for college was just the start of it!) Other people find solace in talking to friends, siblings, therapists, or all of the above. Again, this is why you built your support network, so when you feel overwhelmed, use this as an opportunity to draw them in and get help when you need it.

Therapists can also work wonders. You should never feel ashamed of reaching out to them.

#### Spend time in nature
Trees are pretty. Look at them.

Something about experts doing research and finding that trees are good for us... It's supposed to help your memory and mood. Anyway, just use this as one of many ideas and enjoy our beautiful planet!

#### Seek perspective from positive social connections
Finally, make time for friends. It's helpful when your friends are part of your schoolwork, such as study buddies or extracurricular pals. However, you should also remember to call your parents, siblings, and other encouraging social connections. They can listen to you, offer advice, and most of all, just give you a different perspective to take you outside your own world for a bit. That perspective can help you see your own situation more clearly and make your problems seem comparatively less important.

In the last article in this series, I conclude with a few thoughts, and provide the books that helped inform this section: [Part 5: Conclusion and Resources](https://austeele.github.io/education/2022/08/07/college-success-5-conclusion-resources.html)
