In this series of articles, I share some thoughts and techniques on **how to exit college with an interesting job**. Thus, I assume you have already decided to enter college. I focus on employability because it is a lot easier to attain other things in life with a stable financial foundation.

In this first article, I will discuss some thoughts on how to choose a path. In the articles that follow, I will discuss how to build a social support system, tips for finding useful resources in college, and some ideas on how to maximize your learning efficiency. The last article concludes and lists further reading.

# Choosing A Path

Your choice of a field of study is a product of your personal interests and priorities. Here, I'd like to offer my own list of do's and don't's, drawn from personal experience and reflections.

# Do's

- Pick something that pays well.

    Financial security allows you to support yourself, pay off college bills, and help others. It is easier to attain other measures of fulfillment when you are free from the mental burden of worrying about paying the bills. But in the range of "starving artist" to "soul-selling investment banker", how much is enough? Do some research on the average cost of living in areas you like, and figure out what annual salary you need to maintain your desired lifestyle. For example, is it important to you to own a Ferrari, or are you happy with a used car? Do you enjoy going out to restaurants with friends, or are you happy to meet up in the park? Do you want to travel? Do you want to start a family someday? Would you find it fulfilling to start a philanthropy with your savings? You might not know all the answers to these questions, and that is ok. In that case, I recommend finding the most up-to-date estimates on the yearly salary to maintain emotional and mental wellbeing. Some years ago, that number was around $70K per year, but likely that number has risen with living costs.

    Once you have an idea of how much you want to make, identify several career paths that would enable you to make that salary. Importantly, check the rate of job growth and the chance that you can get a job. Some jobs might appear to be well-paying, but an oversupply of college grads in that field can make it difficult to get the job in the first place. For example, some years ago I heard this was true of the legal profession.

- Pick something that gives you options

    From the above exercise, perhaps you found five different career paths that pay what you want to earn. Among these, I recommend finding those fields which give you the most options for future career paths. As you go through college, you will grow in unexpected ways, so what you want now is likely to change, both in college and throughout life. (We humans are notoriously bad at predicting how we will feel in the future: https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200825-why-predicting-our-future-feelings-is-so-difficult). Thus, it's important to leave yourself some flexibility by choosing a major which gives you several career options which pay well. This is the primary reason I selected electrical engineering: I have seen these majors become not only engineers, but also doctors, lawyers, business people, finance people, entrepreneurs, teachers, and a myriad of other types of professionals. Furthermore, as I learned more about engineering after entering the workforce, I realized there are many different types of work you can do as an engineer, from the stuff you learn in classes (like circuits and programming) to the things they never have time to teach you (like quality engineering and program management). Whether you prefer working with computers or with people, there is a job in electrical engineering for you. Other majors can also open such doors, such as computer science or applied math. Selecting something non-mathematical cuts you off from the huge variety of technical professions available today, which is why I most often recommend STEM of some sort. At the very least, it is worth taking some technical classes in college to improve your mathematical and scientific reasoning skills, which are critical for the future of work.

- Pick something that sparks your curiosity

    College is a time of learning, and even if you pivot fields after college (given your super-flexible major-of-choice), you will spend the next four years of your life thinking about your subject matter. So find something that you find intriguing in some way, something that makes you ask questions. In my case, I had been advised by a high school teacher to do engineering, and I had a potential job lined up after high school if I majored in some engineering field. So I sat down to browse the Wikipedia article on "Engineering" and ended up choosing electrical because "I always wondered how a light switch works." (Boy, did I learn about how a light switch works!). Joke aside, there is some truth to the matter that I did not like wandering blindly throughout life, relying on things as ordinary as electric lights, and not really understanding how they worked. College was a time for me to get answers to some fundamental curiosities, and I got to learn a lot of cool stuff (how antennas work, what computers are made of, how to program, and much more!)


# Don't's
- Don't necessarily select what you think is your passion now

    What you find interesting now is not necessarily what you will find interesting in the future. I have found that passions change over time with exposure to different domains. When I sat down to read that Wikipedia article, I was convinced that I wanted to be the next Mozart. While I still deeply love music, I found that I became more impassioned by other subjects the more I learned about them.

    Even if you are still convinced that your passion will never change, but your passion will not lead to a well-paying job, you should still major in an employable field. There are countless examples of people who pay the bills with one career path, then develop a hobby on the side, sometimes even choosing to commit to the hobby full-time after an early retirement. Their experience with their main career path can even give them an interesting advantage, such as Nathan Myhrvold, a photographer who uses his mastery of technology to make truly unique food art: https://modernistcuisine.com/about/nathan/. The other advantage can be merely financial. You can express a lot more creative freedom when you aim to please yourself, and not a wealthy patron.

- Don't worry too much about picking the "right thing"

    This is the reason for the advice to select something which maximizes your future options. Ultimately, you can take comfort in the fact that there is no one "right thing" for you, no universal truth that you somehow missed. In reality, you'll likely try many different jobs throughout life and learn through first-hand experience what you like and what you don't, rather than pondering the question in your dorm room. There are plenty of things that will deserve your mental bandwidth in college. Worrying about picking the perfect major is a nice one to cross off the list.

- Don't self-select out of majors because of irrelevant factors

    It is a good exercise to reflect on what you find interesting and what turns you away. If you have a strong reaction to something, ask yourself, why? Is there some part of your identity that doesn't fit what you envision in that field? Are your assumptions true? Are you afraid of failure? I encourage you to read about Carol Dweck's Growth Mindset studies and realize that you can grow into something that you might not immediately think is for you.

## A pitch for engineering

I most frequently recommend engineering as a great career path to students, as it provides a comfortable salary and good working conditions, has top rates of job growth, is extremely useful to society, and has lots of interesting problems to explore. It cleanly checks off all criteria on the "do's" list above.

You can even pick an engineering field with strong ties to another interest of yours. For example, I know quite a few audio engineers who loved music in their youth. Just make sure to do your research on rates of job growth and areas which employ those majors, as not all engineering fields are equal in this regard.

If math scares you, you can pick certain types of engineering that require less of it (i.e. computer science instead of electrical engineering). But again, if math scares you, ask yourself why, and realize that there might be things you haven't tried yet that would help you through it (see [Part 4: Learning Better](https://austeele.github.io/education/2022/08/07/college-success-4-learning-better.html)). Math can be difficult to teach well, so don't be too hard on yourself if you find it challenging.

You don't need to eat pizza and wear a hoodie while binging on video games in a dingy basement to be a good engineer. You don't need to have been taking apart computers since you were a toddler to be a good engineer. You don't even need to go to the best engineering school or get straight A's to be a good engineer. What you *do* need is a strong support system (encouraging family and friends who hold you accountable and believe in you), resources, and proper learning techniques.

In the following articles, I discuss these three critical components, as they apply to any direction you choose to take in college and will ultimately help you get the job you want.
