# Conclusion
I recently chatted with some of my colleagues over lunch and asked them all the same question: what advice would you give to your younger self, just about to enter college? They all said something along the lines of "I would have told myself to enjoy life a little more." Sure, they were all high achievers, and perhaps there are some low achievers out there who would have given themselves the opposite advice. However, I think there is some wisom in their advice: whatever your chosen path, go out each day determined to make the most of the experience and enjoy life to its fullest! The real secret weapon in life is to have fun.

If there's one thing I'd like you to remember from this article, it's to surround yourself with a diverse group of good people who support you in different ways. If you just do that, you will learn the rest of this article through experience.

# Resources and Recommended Reading
Remember to take all books with a grain of salt. However, the skill of thinking critically about a subject comes more readily the more one reads, as you expose yourself to multiple perspectives. Without further ado, here are some books where I heard of the ideas I talk about in this article. I encourage you to pick them up when you have time!

Mindset, by Carol Dweck
A quick summary of the book: people with a fixed mindset believe that failure exposes their true nature, whereas people with a growth mindset believe that they can use failure to learn. Adopting a growth mindset will help you everywhere in life.

The Extended Mind, by Annie Murphy Paul
This book brims with research on how the brain learns information. Many of the ideas from this article come from that book (such as how to learn with experts and peers, the impact of nature on the mind, the idea of knowledge maps, and the importance of using one's hands to learn).

Moonwalking with Einstein, by Joshua Foer
This book is a fun read that introduces some of the memory techniques I mentioned in this article, such as memory palaces, exaggeration, and the major system. Many other books discuss the same topics, but this book tells a good story in addition to providing useful information.

The Expectation Effect, by David Robson
I enjoyed that this book opened a few avenues of questioning to classic psychological research.

How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie
If you need some help in the friends department, Dale has your back. This one is a classic.
