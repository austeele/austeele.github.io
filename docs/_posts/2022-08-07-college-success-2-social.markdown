We humans are social creatures. In the individualist culture of the United States, we often forget that fact, but in reality our social ties have an outsized influence on our lives. I once heard a quote that "you are the average of the five people with whom you spend the most time," and I have found that to be close to the truth.

Rather than allowing it to sap your sense of identity, you can use this knowledge to your advantage by analyzing your social connections and making adjustments where necessary. In this second article, I'll discuss some techniques.

# Analyzing your current connections

Ask yourself the following:
- Who encourages me and has contributed to my previous success? Hopefully, this group includes your parents, siblings, and other supportive family members and friends. Look for the people who cheer you on, no matter what. Ensure that you show gratitude to these people for their support, and do your best to support them back. Strengthen these relationships.
- Who is draining my energy? This might take a bit of introspection, since we don't always pay attention to how others make us feel. Perhaps there are some friends who tease you too much, or that acquiantance who constantly complains. While you don't need to completely cut ties with these people, you might consider spending more time with the people who provide you with the energy you need to meet your goals.
- Who do I want to please? This group of people can hold you accountable for meeting your goals. This list should overlap with the first group of people. If you find yourself trying to please people who drain your energy, consider changing that.

# The people you'll meet in college
Beyond your current social ties, you will also meet lots of new people in college. You don't need to have tons of friends in college, but rather high-quality social connections. I advise forming strong ties with the following groups of people:
1. Peers in your same major. The first day of class, sit next to the kid at the front of the classroom and get her contact information. She's at the front of the classroom because she cares about the subject and about doing well. She's probably a lot better than you in the subject, too. That's what you want! Befriend her so you can learn together, have fun together while studying, and take the occasional study break. It will be a lot harder for you to drop out of your program if it means abandoning your best friend.
2. Teaching Assistants. These are the students, graduate or undergrad, who help the professor teach the class, grade assignments, and host study sessions. They are often better at explaining the subject than professors because they more recently learned the material and remember what it was like to not know the subject. They can help you through the difficult homework problems, help you build your scaffolding of knowledge, and even give you a confidence boost. One of my TAs had an enormous influence on me. As I struggled through pop quiz after pop quiz in an introductory electrical engineering class, I thought of dropping the major, thinking that I was not doing well enough. I bugged the TA in this class every other day. To my surprise, one time he asked me what class I would take next! Clearly, if he assumed that I would take the next course, I wasn't doing all that poorly. Thanks to him, and many others, I got through the major.
3. Professors. Professors might not have as much time as TA's, but they are worth getting to know. Ask them about their life experiences, why they chose their path, and where they see the future of the field. Ask them about their research. They might even have opportunities for you to contribute to their research and gain experience in a lab. Overall, professors have lots of interesting stories to share, and you will learn more from them in one-on-one office hours sessions than in lecture. Some professors might also have industry connections with companies you have an interest in working for; if you can be a top student in their class, they are more likely to recommend you for a job. Finally, if you wish to continue your education later, your professors can write you recommendations for graduate schools.
4. Peers in other majors or extracurriculars. These people can help you learn more about the world outside of your major and can help you relax when you need it. Be open to what you will learn from these new friends!

Of these four groups of people, it goes without saying that you should also apply the same filter you did to your existing connections. If the person at the front of the classroom is rude, it isn't worth being her best friend. If someone pressures you to do drugs or alcohol, run. You need to preserve that brainpower for your studies, and those things are bad for your health anyway. There are many people in college, and you should feel empowered to build your support network in the way that will work best for you.

# Turning your connections into a support system
Now that you have your list of positive, encouraging family and friends, and an eye on future connections, how do you ensure they give you the support you need to get through college?

Firstly, find your closest confidants, especially those you look up to and want to please. They should of course be from the encouraging group of people. Tell them your goals: what major you plan to complete and when you plan to complete it by. For example, you might say "I am going to major in computer science, and I am going to do it in four years." See how they react. If they tell you they are not sure you can do it, ask them why (it might be insightful feedback that you can learn from), but also find others who believe in you and will support you. Find a few people you look up to who believe in you and can help you through the times with advice and a morale boost when you're down.

Beyond this explicit ask, there are many more subtle ways that your family and friends support you. Pay attention to when you're feeling like you need someone to talk to, or when you just want to relax a little, and hang out with these positive people. They will give you the energy you need to return to your studies with renewed excitement and vigor.

Although people are your dearest asset, there are a few general resources that most colleges have and which you should be aware of, which I discuss in the next article: [Part 3: Using Your Resources](https://austeele.github.io/education/2022/08/07/college-success-3-resources.html)
